Web scraping is the automated extraction of information from websites using HTTP requests and HTML parsing. Key libraries include requests for sending requests and Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML. CSS selectors help target specific elements, such  
as product titles and prices. Extracted data is stored in structured formats like pandas Data Frames , facilitating analysis and manipulation. Visualization tools like matplotlib aid in understanding trends through graphical representation. Ethical practices require respecting a website's robots.txt file and terms of service to avoid legal issues.
